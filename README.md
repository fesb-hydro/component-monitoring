## Usage   
The app was built for the team that was running in [Hydrocontest competition](http://www.hydrocontest.org/en/) from July 24th to July 30th, 2016 at Lausanne, Switzerland. The team passed the qualifications and participated in the competition as seen in the picture below. Data gathered by the app was studied and used for improvements in next years submission.
